                        Building a robotic arm has been a project I have wanted to pursue for a long time, and the image above shows the first iteration of its physical components.
                        The project is currently in progress as I develop a detailed CAD model in <b>SolidWorks</b>, designed to achieve <b>six degrees of freedom</b> while housing an <b>Arduino microcontroller</b> and multiple <b>servo motors.</b>
                        To improve reliability, the initial ball-and-socket joint will be replaced with a more standard hinge-like mechanism, ensuring greater stability and precision.
                        Internal channels are being incorporated into the design to manage wiring and maintain a clean overall look.
                        Since all components will be <b>3D printed</b>, I am optimizing the model to minimize material usage and reduce print times without compromising structural integrity.
                        This process is strengthening my skills in <b>additive manufacturing</b> and applying Design for Additive Manufacturing principles.

                        For this project, I designed an <b>adjustable laptop stand</b> with the goal of improving ergonomics and usability while keeping the structure lightweight and efficient to manufacture. 
                        I created the <b>CAD model</b> in <b>SolidWorks</b> and optimized the geometry to provide strength and stability while minimizing material usage. 
                        The stand incorporates a <b>slot and sliding mechanism</b> that allows adjustment to different heights, ensuring flexibility of use while maintaining airflow around the laptop. 
                        I carefully defined <b>tolerances</b> for the sliding components to ensure smooth motion and precise fit, accounting for <b>3D printing constraints.</b> 
                        Next steps include optimizing the design for my printer’s build volume, running <b>FEA simulations</b> to assess performance under load, and adding grooves to the slot mechanism to prevent unintentional collapse.

                        This project is an ongoing exploration of <b>3D printing</b> as I familiarize myself with my first <b>printer</b>. To build a foundation, I have been creating a variety of <b>sample parts</b> for <b>learning</b> and <b>testing</b> purposes, which has helped me better understand <b>tolerancing</b>, <b>slicer settings</b>, and how parameters such as <b>infill density</b> and <b>layer height</b> affect <b>print time</b>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One of my first test parts was a <b>spiral spring</b>, which I used to study the <b>flexibility of PLA</b> and evaluate how easily printed parts can bend. This experiment will help me optimize future <b>spring designs</b>. I also designed and printed a simple <b>spur gear mechanism</b> to understand how <b>tolerancing in SolidWorks</b> translates into physical parts. Using a <b>0.3 mm tolerance</b>, I found that the larger gear fit the base more smoothly than the smaller one, likely because the <b>printer nozzle</b> had to make sharper turns during the smaller gear’s print. After lightly filing the base, the smaller gear achieved the same smooth motion as the larger one.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These early projects have given me valuable insights into both the technical and practical aspects of <b>additive manufacturing</b>, and this section will continue to grow as I print more <b>complex parts</b> and experiment with new ideas.

                        As part of University of Toronto Supermilage Team's (UTSM) Mechanical team, I <b>designed</b> 2 aerodynamic wheel wells and 2 tie rod covers and <b>integrated</b> them into the full <b>CAD assembly</b> in <b>SolidWorks.</b> 
                        I used SolidWorks to measure the available space for these components and <b>accounted for their full range of motion</b> to ensure that the design covered the wheels and tie rods throughout every aspect of a turn. 
                        My focus was on meeting regulatory requirements while also <b>maintaining proper clearances and alignment</b> within the larger assembly. 
                        This process improved the structural fit of the design and contributed to the overall aerodynamic efficiency of the vehicle. 
                        It also gave me valuable experience working with <b>large-scale CAD models</b> and collaborating within a complex design workflow.

                        The <b>Hanging Gardens of Chestnut</b> was a conceptual <b>green roof design</b> for the 3rd-floor rooftop of <b>Chestnut Residence</b>, a dorm with over 1,100 students. 
                        The goal was to make the rooftop a safe, welcoming, and visually appealing space that could be used year-round, while also improving <b>energy efficiency</b> by reducing <b>heat loss</b>. 
                        This redesign was projected to save about <b>$12,000 annually</b> on HVAC costs, giving the client a 0.5% to 2% return on investment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I worked with a team of five engineers, and together we spent countless hours researching, modeling, and evaluating over 50 design concepts using <b>Excel</b> and <b>AutoCAD</b>. 
                        After narrowing them down, we developed a high-feasibility <b>green roof plan</b> that balanced both functionality and efficiency.

                    <p>
                        My role also involved conducting client interviews and technical scoping sessions to make sure we captured the client’s vision. 
                        I helped turn those insights into a detailed <b>70+ page concept design specification</b> that fit within the budget and code requirements. 
                        Finally, I presented our proposal, along with a slide deck, to the Engineering Manager and department executives, and our design was approved to move forward into the <b>implementation feasibility study</b>.

                    <p>
                        The first-year <b>Dynamics</b> course taught me more than just the fundamentals of physics behind moving objects. 
                        After learning about moving particles, systems of particles, rigid bodies, and linkages, I found <b>vibrations</b> particularly intriguing. 
                        Although this was an exciting new concept, I struggled to visualize the connection between vibrations and <b>differential equations</b>, specifically how vibrations are modeled using them. 
                        I realized that my understanding of the material would improve if I had a program where I could manipulate different conditions and variables of a vibration and see both a visual representation of the motion and the differential equation that describes it. 
                        After some research, I came across a few resources where others had created similar tools. Inspired by those, I developed an <b>animation</b> using <b>Matplotlib</b> and <b>Python</b>, where I can input a differential equation and see both a vibrating particle on a spring and a simultaneous graph of the equation.
                    </p>    
                    <p>
                        Since this provides a basic understanding of simple vibrations involving only one spring, my next step for the project would be to expand it to more advanced scenarios, such as multiple springs positioned at different angles. 
                        Adding this feature, where vibrations are influenced by several sources and factors, would allow users to explore more complex problems and support deeper learning about vibrations and differential equations.
