            <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I'm a Mechanical Engineering student at the University of Toronto with a strong interest in the intersection of electronics and mechanical systems. My curiosity has led me to explore the fields of mechatronics and robotics, where I’m excited by the possibilities of intelligent design and automation.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                As a Mechanical Design Engineer on the U of T Supermileage team, I contribute to the design and manufacturing of a hydrogen-powered, fuel-efficient vehicle. This experience, along with my personal projects, has allowed me to develop skills in CAD—particularly using SolidWorks to visualize and iterate on mechanical concepts.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                In my free time, I enjoy creating CAD models of design ideas that interest me, focusing on concepts I hope to bring to life through my 3D Printer. While some of these projects remain digital for now, they reflect my passion for design thinking and engineering creativity.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                As I continue to grow and develop as an engineer, I invite you to take a look at some of the work I've done so far and follow along on my journey.

                    <p>
                        Building a robotic arm has been a project I have wanted to pursue for a long time, and the image above shows the first iteration of its physical components.
                        The project is currently in progress as I develop a detailed CAD model in <b>SolidWorks</b>, designed to achieve <b>six degrees of freedom</b> while housing an <b>Arduino microcontroller</b> and multiple <b>servo motors.</b>
                        To improve reliability, the initial ball-and-socket joint will be replaced with a more standard hinge-like mechanism, ensuring greater stability and precision.
                        Internal channels are being incorporated into the design to manage wiring and maintain a clean overall look.
                        Since all components will be <b>3D printed</b>, I am optimizing the model to minimize material usage and reduce print times without compromising structural integrity.
                        This process is strengthening my skills in <b>additive manufacturing</b> and applying Design for Additive Manufacturing principles.

                        The Hanging Gardens of Chestnut was a conceptual green roof design for the 3rd-floor rooftop of Chestnut Residence, a dorm with over 1,100 students. The goal was to make the rooftop a safe, welcoming, and visually appealing space that could be used year-round, while also improving energy efficiency by reducing heat loss. This redesign was projected to save about $12,000 annually on HVAC costs, giving the client a 0.5% to 2% return on investment.

                    <p>
                        I worked with a team of five engineers, and together we spent countless hours researching, modeling, and evaluating over 50 design concepts using Excel and AutoCAD. After narrowing them down, we developed a high-feasibility green roof plan that balanced both functionality and efficiency.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                        My role also involved conducting client interviews and technical scoping sessions to make sure we captured the client’s vision. I helped turn those insights into a detailed 70+ page concept design specification that fit within the budget and code requirements. Finally, I presented our proposal, along with a slide deck, to the Engineering Manager and department executives, and our design was approved to move forward into the implementation feasibility study.

                    <p>
                        The first-year Dynamics course taught me more than just the fundamentals of physics behind moving objects.
                        After learning about moving particles, systems of particles, rigid bodies, and linkages, I found vibrations particularly intriguing.
                        Although this was an exciting new concept, I struggled to visualize the connection between vibrations and differential equations; specifically, how vibrations are modeled using them.
                        I realized that my understanding of the material would improve if I had some kind of calculator or program where I could manipulate different conditions and variables of a vibration and see both a visual representation of the motion and the differential equation that describes it.
                        After some googling and research, I came across a few resources where others had created similar tools.
                        Inspired by those, I developed an animation using Matplotlib and Python, where I can simply input a differential equation and see both a vibrating particle on a spring and a simultaneous graph of the equation.
                    </p>    
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Since this provides a basic understanding of simple vibrations involving only one spring, my next step for the project would be to expand it to more advanced scenarios, such as multiple springs positioned at different angles.
                        Adding this feature, where vibrations are influenced by several sources and factors, would allow users to explore more complex problems and support deeper learning about vibrations and differential equations.
