                        This project involved the complete conceptual development of a long-reach robotic arm designed for beginner cinematographers. 
                        Our team of five mechanical engineering students followed a full engineering design process that included benchmarking, specification development, concept generation, and analytical evaluation. 
                        During benchmarking, the team examined more than ten commercial robotic camera systems. 
                        We compared quantitative performance factors such as reach, payload, operating speed, and assembled weight. 
                        This work guided the creation of engineering specifications that included a minimum reach of 1.5 meters, a payload range of 3 to 7 kilograms, an assembled mass under 100 kilograms, an assembly time under 45 minutes, and a cost limit of 3000 dollars. 
                        These requirements ensured that the project remained realistic for our skill level and accessible for the intended user group.
                        <br><br>
                        With clear specifications in place, the team generated four candidate mechanical architectures that used different mechanical approaches. 
                        These approaches included belt drives, planetary gearboxes, linear actuators, telescoping arm segments, and wrist structures with gimbal-type joints. 
                        Each design was modeled and refined through torque calculations, mass estimation, and basic motion analysis. 
                        Joint 1 required a 75:1 planetary gearbox that provided 195 newton-meters of output torque. 
                        This value produced an angular acceleration of 5.9 radians per second squared for the 86.7 kilogram base. 
                        Joint 2 needed 450 newton-meters of torque after gearbox reduction to rotate a 36.9 kilogram arm segment with a moment of inertia of about 83 kilogram meter squared. 
                        Linear actuator requirements were also calculated using lead screw mechanics to confirm that the actuators could extend smoothly under load. 
                        These analytical steps allowed the team to identify which design elements were feasible within the cost and performance limits.
                        <br><br>
                        To select the final design, the team created a weighted Pugh Matrix that compared all four concepts to a benchmark robot. 
                        The comparison used criteria such as degrees of freedom, reach, payload capacity, motion speed, cost, weight, and assembly difficulty. 
                        Candidate Design 2 ranked the highest with a total score of plus six because it offered the best balance of reach, stability, portability, and cost performance. 
                        The final design combined the strongest elements from all concepts. 
                        It used the two-axis base and coordinated belt-driven joints from Design 2, the linear actuator arrangement from Designs 3 and 4, and lightweight brushless motors at the wrist to achieve precise camera control. 
                        The resulting six-joint structure supported more than 1.5 meters of reach and carried a 3 to 7 kilogram payload while remaining compatible with common household power.
                        <br><br>
                        Completing this project helped me progress toward my career goals of becoming a mechanical design engineer. 
                        I want to work in fields that connect robotics, mechanical design, and real engineering applications. 
                        This project supported those goals by giving me experience with system-level design, mechanical analysis, component selection, and structured decision making. 
                        Designing a robotic arm from the ground up strengthened my ability to solve complex engineering problems and improved my teamwork and communication skills. 
                        These abilities are essential for future work in robotics and in broader engineering design roles.

                        I built a one-cylinder pneumatic engine as a precision machining and assembly project, which reflects my passion for mechanical design and turning conceptual ideas into functional products. 
                        For this project, I manufactured eight aluminum and steel components to professional engineering drawings using a manual mill, lathe, and drill press. 
                        The parts were finished to ±0.001 in tolerances and 32 µin Ra surfaces. 
                        They were then assembled with careful alignment and sealing techniques that were verified using dial indicators and micrometers. 
                        The completed engine was tested under 40–100 psi compressed air. 
                        It achieved stable operation at roughly 1,200 RPM and demonstrated airtight performance, smooth motion, and overall mechanical reliability. 
                        This project strengthened my interest in engineering roles that combine creative design with hands-on development.

                        For this project, I worked as part of a four-person Mechanical Engineering team to design and build a fully 3D printed right angle gearbox that achieved a minimum 3:1 speed reduction. 
                        The input and output shafts had intersecting axes of rotation, and the design ensured smooth power transmission, proper gear meshing, and a compact and easy-to-assemble layout. 
                        I contributed to the mechanical design, created professional engineering drawings, and produced detailed design documentation to clearly communicate our decisions, calculations, and manufacturing considerations. 
                        After finalizing the base configuration, I added an offset between the input and output shafts to better replicate the functionality of the original part and expand the capabilities of the design. The completed gearbox was successfully 3D printed, assembled, and tested. 
                        It demonstrated reliable performance and validated the effectiveness of our collaborative design approach.

                        For this project, I designed an adjustable laptop stand with the goal of improving ergonomics and usability while keeping the structure lightweight and efficient to manufacture. 
                        I created the CAD model in SolidWorks and optimized the geometry to provide strength and stability while minimizing material usage. 
                        The stand includes a slot and sliding mechanism that allows adjustment to different heights. This ensures flexibility of use while maintaining airflow around the laptop. 
                        I carefully defined tolerances for the sliding components to ensure smooth motion and precise fit, taking 3D printing constraints into account. 
                        The next steps for this project include optimizing the design for my printer’s build volume, running FEA simulations to assess performance under load, and adding grooves to the slot mechanism to prevent unintentional collapse.

                        As part of the University of Toronto Supermileage Team’s Mechanical team, I designed two aerodynamic wheel wells and two tie rod covers and integrated them into the full CAD assembly in SolidWorks. 
                        I measured the available space for these components in SolidWorks and accounted for their full range of motion to ensure that the design covered the wheels and tie rods throughout every stage of a turn. 
                        My focus was on meeting regulatory requirements while maintaining proper clearances and alignment within the larger assembly. 
                        This process improved the structural fit of the design and supported the aerodynamic efficiency of the vehicle. 
                        It also gave me meaningful experience working with large-scale CAD models and collaborating within a complex design workflow.

                        This project is an ongoing exploration of <b>3D printing</b> as I familiarize myself with my first <b>printer</b>. To build a foundation, I have been creating a variety of <b>sample parts</b> for <b>learning</b> and <b>testing</b> purposes, which has helped me better understand <b>tolerancing</b>, <b>slicer settings</b>, and how parameters such as <b>infill density</b> and <b>layer height</b> affect <b>print time</b>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One of my first test parts was a <b>spiral spring</b>, which I used to study the <b>flexibility of PLA</b> and evaluate how easily printed parts can bend. This experiment will help me optimize future <b>spring designs</b>. I also designed and printed a simple <b>spur gear mechanism</b> to understand how <b>tolerancing in SolidWorks</b> translates into physical parts. Using a <b>0.3 mm tolerance</b>, I found that the larger gear fit the base more smoothly than the smaller one, likely because the <b>printer nozzle</b> had to make sharper turns during the smaller gear’s print. After lightly filing the base, the smaller gear achieved the same smooth motion as the larger one.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These early projects have given me valuable insights into both the technical and practical aspects of <b>additive manufacturing</b>, and this section will continue to grow as I print more <b>complex parts</b> and experiment with new ideas.

                        The <b>Hanging Gardens of Chestnut</b> was a conceptual <b>green roof design</b> for the 3rd-floor rooftop of <b>Chestnut Residence</b>, a dorm with over 1,100 students. 
                        The goal was to make the rooftop a safe, welcoming, and visually appealing space that could be used year-round, while also improving <b>energy efficiency</b> by reducing <b>heat loss</b>. 
                        This redesign was projected to save about <b>$12,000 annually</b> on HVAC costs, giving the client a 0.5% to 2% return on investment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I worked with a team of five engineers, and together we spent countless hours researching, modeling, and evaluating over 50 design concepts using <b>Excel</b> and <b>AutoCAD</b>. 
                        After narrowing them down, we developed a high-feasibility <b>green roof plan</b> that balanced both functionality and efficiency.

                        My role also involved conducting client interviews and technical scoping sessions to make sure we captured the client’s vision. 
                        I helped turn those insights into a detailed <b>70+ page concept design specification</b> that fit within the budget and code requirements. 
                        Finally, I presented our proposal, along with a slide deck, to the Engineering Manager and department executives, and our design was approved to move forward into the <b>implementation feasibility study</b>.

                        The first-year <b>Dynamics</b> course taught me more than just the fundamentals of physics behind moving objects. 
                        After learning about moving particles, systems of particles, rigid bodies, and linkages, I found <b>vibrations</b> particularly intriguing. 
                        Although this was an exciting new concept, I struggled to visualize the connection between vibrations and <b>differential equations</b>, specifically how vibrations are modeled using them. 
                        I realized that my understanding of the material would improve if I had a program where I could manipulate different conditions and variables of a vibration and see both a visual representation of the motion and the differential equation that describes it. 
                        After some research, I came across a few resources where others had created similar tools. Inspired by those, I developed an <b>animation</b> using <b>Matplotlib</b> and <b>Python</b>, where I can input a differential equation and see both a vibrating particle on a spring and a simultaneous graph of the equation.

                        Since this provides a basic understanding of simple vibrations involving only one spring, my next step for the project would be to expand it to more advanced scenarios, such as multiple springs positioned at different angles. 
                        Adding this feature, where vibrations are influenced by several sources and factors, would allow users to explore more complex problems and support deeper learning about vibrations and differential equations.
